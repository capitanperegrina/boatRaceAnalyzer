## boatRaceAnalyzer

boatRaceAnalyzer is by now, a stupid console spring boot application to load http://www.estela.co/open csv sailrace files into a database and then generate a complete html file with the corresponding tracking and data for each segment of the track such as: location, sog, vmg, dtd, cog...

There is a database model in the resources folder of api's project and a zip containing javascript necessary files to the generated html work propperly.

You may look in http://www.capitanperegrina.com for extra and probably unuseful information.
